# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project helps in understanding how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing their step-by-step execution with animations.


##  Features

* Visualizes popular sorting algorithms.
* Adjustable sorting speed.
* Random array generation.
* Clean and responsive UI.
* Easy to understand for DSA beginners.

## Algorithms Implemented

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort


##  Tech Stack

* HTML – Structure
* CSS – Styling & animations
* JavaScript – Logic & algorithm implementation



## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click on **index.html** or open it in any modern browser.


## Learning Outcomes

* Improved understanding of sorting algorithms.
* Hands-on experience with JavaScript logic.
* Better grasp of time complexity and algorithm behavior.


## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add more algorithms. (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
* Add array size control.
* Improve UI animations.
